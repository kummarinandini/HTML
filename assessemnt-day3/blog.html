            <h1 align="center"><b>Blog</b></h1>
            <p>Blogs are based on casual writing and it is not based on interview or research.It<br>
            contains tips, lessons, opinions and tools etc. Generally blogs are less than 300 words<br>
            and sometimes less than 1000 words means comparatively smaller than articles. The writer can<br>
            publish any blog without any requirement of any editor.</p>

                <h3>Types</h3>
                 <hr>
                <p>There are many different types of blogs, differing not only in the type of content, but also in the way that content is 
                delivered or written.</p>
                
                <h4>Personal blogs</h4>
                <p>The personal blog is an ongoing online diary or commentary written by an individual, rather than a corp
                oration or organization. While the vast majority of personal blogs attract very few readers, other than the 
                blogger's immediate family and friends, a small number of personal blogs have become popular, to the point 
                that they have attracted lucrative advertising sponsorship. A tiny number of personal bloggers have become 
                famous, both in the online community and in the real world.</p>
                
                <h4>Collaborative blogs or group blogs</h4>
                <p>A type of weblog in which posts are written and published by more than one author. The majority of high-
                profile collaborative blogs are organised according to a single uniting theme, such as politics, technology 
                or advocacy. In recent years, the blogosphere has seen the emergence and growing popularity of more collabo
                rative efforts, often set up by already established bloggers wishing to pool time and resources, both to reduce 
                the pressure of maintaining a popular website and to attract a larger readership.</p>
               
                <h4>Microblogging</h4>
                <p>Microblogging is the practice of posting small pieces of digital content—which could be text, pictures, links,
                short videos, or other media—on the Internet. Microblogging offers a portable communication mode that feels organic 
                and spontaneous to many users. It has captured the public imagination, in part because the short posts are easy to 
                read on the go or when waiting. Friends use it to keep in touch, business associates use it to coordinate meetings or 
                share useful resources, and celebrities and politicians (or their publicists) microblog about concert dates, lectures, 
                book releases, or tour schedules.</p>
                
                <h4>Corporate and organizational blogs</h4>
                <p>A blog can be private, as in most cases, or it can be for business or not-for-profit organization or government 
                purposes. Blogs used internally, and only available to employees via an Intranet are called corporate blogs. Companies
                use internal corporate blogs enhance the communication, culture and employee engagement in a corporation. Internal corporate
                blogs can be used to communicate news about company policies or procedures, build employee esprit de corps and improve morale.
                Companies and other organizations also use external, publicly accessible blogs for marketing, branding, or public relations 
                purposes. Some organizations have a blog authored by their executive; in practice, many of these executive blog posts are 
                penned by a ghostwriter, who makes posts in the style of the credited author. Similar blogs for clubs and societies are 
                called club blogs, group blogs, or by similar names; typical use is to inform members and other interested parties of club
                 and member activities.</p>
                
                <h4>Aggregated blogs</h4>
                <p>Individuals or organization may aggregate selected feeds on specific topic, product or service and provide combined view for 
                its readers. This allows readers to concentrate on reading instead of searching for quality on-topic content and managing subscriptions.
                 Many such aggregation called planets from name of Planet (software) that perform such aggregation, hosting sites usually have planet. 
                 subdomain in domain name (like http://planet.gnome.org/).</p>
