        <p>Life is full of challenges. Some people seem to meet every challenge with confidence, 
        while others struggle to overcome them. Pittas especially get a sense of satisfaction from
        facing challenges head on—it brings a sense of accomplishment and can be very fulfilling. On
        some level, you actually seek challenges. Your highest self wants you to learn and grow, and
        life’s most effective tool toward growth is experience.</p>
        
        <p>The problem is that all too often you might find yourself faced with the same challenges
        over and over again, and that’s when you start to lose motivation to face the issue and lose
        sight of the potential lesson. At that point, challenges can become problems that can spiral
        you into despair and frustration.</p>
        
        <p>As a co-creator of your own reality, you have the ability to overcome these challenges.
        It is with this sense of responsibility and awareness that you can begin your journey into
        a higher state of consciousness where challenges are no longer challenges, but opportunities
        to get a glimpse of your highest self.</p> 
       
        <p>Here are some ways to better accept and meet your personal challenges, whatever they may be.</p>
        <article>
            <h3>Face the Challenge</h3>
            <p>In many cases this is the most important step, the most obvious step, yet it is also the most
            often missed. People spend time looking for a way around the issue, or wallowing in despair at the
            enormity of the challenge, instead of facing it. Even mundane things, like a pileup of laundry or 
            work, get ignored. Putting a challenge off doesn’t make it go away. This is true of big challenges,
            as well as the small ones. The most important thing you can do is face what’s in front of you head
            on.</p>

            <h3>Be Present</h3>
            <p>Do not underestimate the power of being present. If you make a practice of facing your challenges—even
            in failure—with full presence and awareness, you will find most challenges are not challenges at all. 
            Instead life’s challenges become messages from the universe. Meditation can help you cultivate silent
            awareness and is a good tool to help bring that focus to yourself during difficult times.</p>

            <p>You can ask yourself questions that help you better understand the problem and how it affects you.</p>
        </article>
        <ul>
           <li>Why is this a challenge?</li>
           <li>Do I believe that I am capable of being successful at this challenge?</li> 
           <li>What are the possible outcomes if I succeed?</li>
            <li>What is the outcome if I fail?</li>
        </ul>    
        <p>These questions are not meant to solve the problem, rather they are meant to help bring you into fuller awareness of the challenge itself and your emotional reaction to it.</p>
