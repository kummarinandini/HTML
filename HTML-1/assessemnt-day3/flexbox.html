            <p>The flexbox or flexible box model in CSS is a one-dimensional layout model
            that has flexible and efficient layouts with distributed spaces among items to
            control their alignment structure ie., it is a layout model that provides an easy
            and clean way to arrange items within a container. Flexbox can be useful for creating
             small-scales layouts & is responsive and mobile-friendly.</p>
