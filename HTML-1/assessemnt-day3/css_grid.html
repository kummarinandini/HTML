        <h4>CSS Grid has taken over the world of web design. Itâ€™s really cool. There are plenty of tutorials, blogs and articles on the internet, which are great sources of knowledge.</h4>

            <h2>What is Grid?</h2>
            <p>CSS Grid allows us to write better layouts using the in-browser capability of grids. Prior to CSS Grid, we either had to use our own custom grid system or something like Bootstrap.<br>
                These other options work fine, but CSS grid takes the pain out of most of the things we faced in those solutions.<br>
                CSS Grid makes it a piece of cake to develop simple and complex layouts. In this blog we will learn some basic terminologies and then go ahead with a simple layout example.</p>
            <h3>Basic Terminologies</h3>
            <p>The basic terms associated with CSS Grid are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Columns</li>
                <li>Rows</li>
                <li>Cells</li>
                <li>Grid Lines</li>
                <li>Gutter</li>
            </ol>
            <center>
            <img src="img (1).png" width="500px">
            </center>
            <p>All the terms are explained in the diagram above. This example is a 3x2 column grid, which means 3 columns and 2 rows.</p>
            <h2>Example Layout</h2>
            <p>Now that the basic concepts are out of the way, we are going to use these concepts to make an example layout like the below:</p>
            <center>
            <img src="t.png" width="600px">
            </center>
            <p>As you can see, there is a header and a footer. Then the center row has 3 columns with nav in the first column sidebar on the right, and the main content area in the center (which occupies most of the row).</p>
